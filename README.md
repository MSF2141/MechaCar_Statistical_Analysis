# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Project Overview
AutosRUs’ newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team’s progress. The data analytics team needs to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.
 
## Objectives
Help the data analytics team do the following:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots.
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population.
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

## Analysis
Three technical analysis parts and a proposal for further statistical study.
- Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Part 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
- Part 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils
- Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

### Part 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
MechaCars produced 50 prototypes (MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset). The prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance. Multiple metrics, such as vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, drivetrain, and ground clearance, were collected for each vehicle. Using R, design a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables. 

### Part 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots. Using your knowledge of R, you’ll create a summary statistics table to show:

The suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots.

The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

Then, in the README.md, you’ll briefly detail and interpret the suspension coil summary statistics.

### Part 3: T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Perform t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are
statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch.

In your README, create a subheading ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils , then briefly summarize your interpretation and
findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

### Part 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition

 Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the
competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few
examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils
must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification
for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
